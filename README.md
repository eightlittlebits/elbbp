## why

It made for a fun afternoon project. Failing to make progress on my other emulator projects recently I though it might be fun to take on a simple one that could actually be "finished" quickly.

## how

Drag and drop a BytePusher file onto the window to load it and start it running, there are sample roms available on the esolangs BytePusher page listed below.
